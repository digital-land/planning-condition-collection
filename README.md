The data and pipeline to build the [XXX dataset](https://www.digital-land.info/dataset/planning-condition).

# Collection

* [collection/source.csv](collection/source.csv) — the list of data sources by organisation, see [specification/source](https://digital-land.github.io/specification/schema/source/)
* [collection/endpoint.csv](collection/endpoint.csv) — the list of endpoint URLs for the collection, see [specification/endpoint](https://digital-land.github.io/specification/schema/endpoint)
* [collection/resource/](collection/resource/) — collected resources

*These files are now stored in AWS S3:*

* [collection/log/](https://files.planning.data.gov.uk/XXX/collection/log/) — individual log JSON files, created by the collection process
* [collection/log.csv](https://files.planning.data.gov.uk/XXX/collection/log.csv) — a collection log assembled from the individual log files, see [specification/log](https://digital-land.github.io/specification/schema/log)
* [collection/resource.csv](https://files.planning.data.gov.uk/XXX/collection/resource.csv) — a list of collected resources, see [specification/resource](https://digital-land.github.io/specification/schema/resource)

# Updating the collection

We recommend working in [virtual environment](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) before installing the python [requirements](requirements.txt), [makerules](https://github.com/digital-land/makerules) and other dependencies. Requires Make v4.0 or above.

    $ make makerules
    $ make init
    $ make collect

# Building the datasets

The collected files can then be converted into a national dataset:

    $ make
